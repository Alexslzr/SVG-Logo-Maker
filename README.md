# SVG Logo Maker

<img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-blue"></img>

## Description

Node.js command-line application that takes in user input to generate a logo and save it as an [SVG file](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scalable_Vector_Graphics). The application prompts the user to select a color and shape, provide text for the logo, and save the generated SVG to a `.svg` file.

### User Story

```md
AS a freelance web developer
I WANT to generate a simple logo for my projects
SO THAT I don't have to pay a graphic designer
```



## Mock-Up

The following image shows a mock-up of the generated SVG given the following input entered by the user: `SVG` for the text, `white` for the text color, `circle` from the list of shapes, and `green` for the shape color. Note that this is just an image of the output SVG and not the SVG file itself:
